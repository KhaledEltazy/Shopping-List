# Shopping List App  

The *Shopping List* is a simple and user-friendly application designed to manage your shopping needs. It allows users to add items, adjust their quantities, and remove them from the shopping list entirely.  

This app was developed as part of the *Philipp Lackner's Android Development Course*, focusing on building apps with modern Android development techniques.
